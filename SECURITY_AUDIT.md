# Security Audit and Improvement Plan

This document outlines the findings of a security audit of the Stock Analyst application and provides a to-do list of recommended improvements to enhance its security posture.

## High-Priority Findings

### 1. Insecure Default Configurations
- **Issue**: The application has hardcoded, weak default values for `SECRET_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `unified_config.py`. If these are not properly overridden in a production environment, it could lead to trivial session hijacking and database compromise.
- **File**: `unified_config.py`
- **Recommendation**:
    - [ ] Remove default hardcoded secrets from the codebase.
    - [ ] Modify the application startup sequence to fail loudly (exit immediately) if critical secrets like `SECRET_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` are not provided in the production environment.
    - [ ] Strengthen the documentation to emphasize the necessity of setting these environment variables for production.

### 2. Insecure Session Cookie Configuration
- **Issue**: The Flask session cookie is not configured with security best practices. It likely lacks the `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Strict` flags, making it vulnerable to sniffing on insecure connections, access via JavaScript (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **File**: `app.py` (or wherever the Flask app is initialized)
- **Recommendation**:
    - [ ] In the Flask application configuration, explicitly set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`, `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True`, and `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax'` (or `'Strict'`) for the production environment.

### 3. Overly Permissive CORS Policy
- **Issue**: The Nginx configuration allows cross-origin requests from any domain (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"`). This is dangerous and should be restricted to only trusted frontend domains.
- **File**: `nginx.conf`
- **Recommendation**:
    - [ ] Replace `add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*";` with a specific, whitelisted domain (e.g., `add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://my-frontend.com";`).
    - [ ] Use a variable or map in Nginx to handle multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) if necessary.

## Medium-Priority Findings

### 4. Lack of Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Issue**: The application is missing a Content Security Policy (CSP) header. A strong CSP is one of the most effective defenses against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling which resources (scripts, styles, images) a browser is allowed to load.
- **File**: `nginx.conf`
- **Recommendation**:
    - [ ] Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) via the `add_header Content-Security-Policy "..."` directive in Nginx. Start with a restrictive policy (e.g., `default-src 'self'`) and gradually allow other sources as needed.

### 5. Potential for Information Leakage in Error Messages
- **Issue**: API endpoints catch generic exceptions and return `str(e)` in the JSON response. This can leak sensitive information about the application's internal state, library versions, or file paths.
- **File**: `api_routes.py`
- **Recommendation**:
    - [ ] Create a centralized error handler.
    - [ ] In production, replace detailed exception messages with generic error messages (e.g., "An internal server error occurred").
    - [ ] Ensure detailed errors are still logged securely on the server-side for debugging purposes.

### 6. Unscanned and Potentially Vulnerable Dependencies
- **Issue**: `requirements.txt` specifies dependencies, some with open-ended versions. There is no automated process to scan these for known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
- **File**: `requirements.txt`
- **Recommendation**:
    - [ ] Integrate a security scanning tool like `pip-audit` or `safety` into the CI/CD pipeline.
    - [ ] Run the scan regularly and upon any dependency changes.
    - [ ] Pin all production dependencies to specific, audited versions in `requirements.pinned.txt` and use that for building the production container.

## Low-Priority Findings

### 7. Missing Rate Limiting on Key Endpoints
- **Issue**: While Nginx has global rate limiting, some computationally expensive or sensitive endpoints (e.g., user registration) could benefit from stricter, specific rate limits to prevent abuse.
- **File**: `nginx.conf`, `api_routes.py`
- **Recommendation**:
    - [ ] Apply stricter rate limits to the user registration endpoint (`/api/v2/auth/register`) to prevent rapid account creation.
    - [ ] Consider applying user-specific (per-IP or per-user_id) rate limits on authenticated endpoints to prevent a single user from overwhelming the system.

### 8. SSL/TLS Not Enforced by Default
- **Issue**: The SSL/TLS configuration in `nginx.conf` is commented out. While this might be handled by an upstream load balancer in the cloud, the default configuration is insecure.
- **File**: `nginx.conf`
- **Recommendation**:
    - [ ] Add a server block to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
    - [ ] Provide a default, self-signed certificate for development and testing, with clear instructions for replacing it with a proper certificate in production.
    - [ ] Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to ensure browsers only connect via HTTPS.
