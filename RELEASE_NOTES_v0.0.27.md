## 🎯 New Features

### 1. Short Squeeze Analysis Engine
- **Quantitative Scoring Algorithm**: Implements the methodology from SQUEEZE.md with weighted component scoring
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Combines Short Interest %, Days to Cover, Float Size, and Momentum indicators
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Classifies data reliability as high, medium, low, or insufficient
- **Risk Level Classification**: Categorizes stocks as high (≥70), moderate (50-69), or low (<50) squeeze potential

**Key Components**:
- **Short Interest % (40% weight)**: Percentage of tradeable shares sold short
- **Days to Cover (30% weight)**: Time required to cover all short positions
- **Float Size (15% weight)**: Number of shares available for trading (inverse relationship)
- **Momentum (15% weight)**: Technical indicators including RSI and relative volume

### 2. Enhanced Data Collection
- **Yahoo Finance Integration**: Extended YahooFinanceClient with short interest data collection
- **Automated Scheduling**: Weekly data updates integrated into the existing scheduler
- **Rate Limiting**: 1-second delays between API calls to respect Yahoo Finance limits
- **Error Classification**: Distinguishes between rate limits and data unavailability

### 3. Database Infrastructure
- **New Tables**: `short_interest_data` and `short_squeeze_scores` with optimized indexes
- **UPSERT Operations**: Efficient data updates with conflict resolution
- **Performance Indexes**: Optimized for symbol-based queries and rankings
